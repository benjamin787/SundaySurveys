# SundaySurveys

A react app meant to allow users to create surveys, answer those of others, and review the results in graph form. The surveys created are stored by Sunday_Surveys_Database and can be accessed by anyone, no direct relationships exist between users.

### Prerequisites

Before you continue please ensure you have the latest version of React installed and a basic knowledge of hooks, routing, and MVC hierarchy.

### Installation and Usage

Fork the repo, clone to local, and *npm install* to handle dependencies. 

*npm start* will launch the app to localhost. The script commands *build*, *test*, and *eject* are also available. As the majority of functionality requires the [backend](https://github.com/benjamin787/survey_app_database), you will need to run two localhosts.
