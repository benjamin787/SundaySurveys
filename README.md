# SundaySurveys

A react app meant to allow users to create surveys, answer those of others, and review the results in graph form. The surveys created are stored by 
Sunday_Surveys_Database and can be accessed by anyone, no direct relationships exist between users.

### Prerequisites

Before you continue please ensure you have the latest versions of React and Ruby installed and a basic knowledge of hooks, routing, MVC hierarchy, and S3.

### Installation and Usage

Fork **both** repos, clone to local, and *bundle install* && *npm install* to handle dependencies. 

*npm start* will launch the FE to localhost. The script commands *build*, *test*, and *eject* are also available. As the majority of functionality requires
the BE, you will need to run two localhosts.

Testing the Ruby on Rails server and S3 dB is most efficient using Postman.
